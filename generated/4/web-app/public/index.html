      <h2>Welcome to the Library Management System</h2>
      <p>
        This library management system is designed to help you manage your library
        books and users with ease. You can add new books to the system, track the
        borrowing and returning of books, and manage users. You can also search for
        books by title, author, or genre, and apply late fees for late returns.
